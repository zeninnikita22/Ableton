          <p>
            Most of us are active musicians, producers, and DJs, and many of us
            use Live and Push every day. We come from a wide range of cultural
            and professional backgrounds. Some of us have PhDs, some are
            self-taught, and most of us are somewhere in between. What connects
            us is the shared belief that each of us has the skills and knowledge
            to contribute to something big: helping to shape the future of music
            culture.

            Rather than having a one-size-fits-all process, we try to give our
            people what they need to work their magic and grow. We’ve learned
            that achieving the best results comes from building teams that are
            richly diverse, and thus able to explore problems from a wider set
            of perspectives. We don’t always agree with each other, but opinion
            and debate are valued and openly encouraged.

            Alongside an internal training program, employees are actively
            supported in acquiring new knowledge and skills, and coached on
            applying these in their daily work. In addition, staff-organized
            development and music salons are a chance to discuss new
            technologies, production techniques and best practices.

            paperwork. We’ll even provide you with free German or English

            maternity and paternity leave. Office hours are flexible, but it’s
            not all work; we have several company and team outings throughout
            the year as well as a variety of fun, informal small-group
